    <h2>Joseph Bodily</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Joseph Bodily and I am from California. My major is Computer Science since I want to work indoors with computers.</p>
    <p>Some things I enjoy doing consists mostly of playing video games, watching anime, and occasionally reading a book.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 20 years. I love everything in the church but my favorite part is the amount of clarity it gives to me.</p>
